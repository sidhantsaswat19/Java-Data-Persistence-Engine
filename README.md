**Java Data Persistence Engine** | Java, System I/O, Data Serialization
**Engineered a multi-format persistence layer** using Java I/O Streams (FileOutputStream, DataOutputStream) to serialize primitives and complex objects into both binary and text formats.

**Implemented hybrid data storage strategies**, utilizing FileWriter and PrintWriter for human-readable logging and DataOutputStream for compact, type-safe binary storage to optimize storage efficiency.

**Designed a robust exception handling mechanism** within file operations to ensure data integrity and prevent resource leaks during high-throughput write cycles.
